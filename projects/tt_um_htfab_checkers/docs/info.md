## How it works

Reproduces the classic Checkers demo by Renaldas Zioma from the [VGA Playground](https://vga-playground.com/), but each layer is generated by a separate module written in a different Python-based HDL:

- [Layer A](../src/layer_a/layer_a.py) uses [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth)

- [Layer B](../src/layer_b/layer_b.py) uses [MyHDL](https://github.com/myhdl/myhdl)

- [Layer C](../src/layer_c/layer_c.py) uses [PyCDE](https://github.com/llvm/circt/tree/main/docs/PyCDE)

- [Layer D](../src/layer_d/layer_d.py) uses [PyRTL](https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL)

- [Layer E](../src/layer_e/layer_e.py) uses [PyMTL3](https://github.com/pymtl/pymtl3)

## How to test

Connect to a screen using the TinyVGA Pmod. Sit back and enjoy. Optionally toggle the `ui_in` inputs to change the colors.
